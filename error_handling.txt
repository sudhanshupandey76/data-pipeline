Error Handling

Strategies:

Logging: We are currently handling the error with try except block,
         We can also implement the logging mechanism(didn't get time to handle it)

Retries: We have implemented to retry the dag once.

Alerts: Airflow alerts are being triggered in case of job failure.
        We can also send the mails for failure

Fallbacks: We can implement the fallback tolerant for the infrastructure.
